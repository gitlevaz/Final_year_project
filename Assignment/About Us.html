<h1 align="center">About university</h1>
<p id="page" align="center">The National School of Business Management (NSBM) is the degree school of National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) and offers undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs in Management, Computing and Engineering. Innovation is the key at NSBM as we understand the importance of originality and creativity in this global world. The education system at NSBM is therefore designed with the intention of ensuring that all our undergraduates are fully prepared to face any challenges the world has to offer.<br><br>

We pride ourselves on the innovative and entrepreneurship qualities that NSBM imparts to its undergraduates through its excellence in teaching and research. Along with our ethnically and culturally diverse workforce we also inculcate International expertise in the fields of Management, Computing and Engineering in partnership with leading universities in the world. NSBM offers world renowned degrees that are much more than just a certificate. Our lecture panel skillfully integrates leadership, ethics, global thinking, core management skills and technological innovations into the learning process to make our undergraduates well rounded global citizens.<br><br>

Our undergraduates enjoy a healthy work-life balance, as NSBM encourages students to develop and pursue their talents and hobbies through various events and activities like the Annual Sports Day and the celebrations of multicultural festivals which showcase their creative and musical abilities.<br><br>

We are also the very first institute in Sri Lanka with green commitment. The modern green university premises of NSBM at Pitipana, Homagama will be completed by the end of 2015. The design of the construction is not only to generate surroundings which cater to the physical and physiological comfort of both students and academics, but also to create structures that would harmonize with the existing physical and natural environment, whilst being techno and ecofriendly, built with the latest technology and modern materials requiring a less maintenance effort. Thus we are a flexible school that adapts to the changes of the 21st century and in turn we help mould our students to be equally flexible and well versed in everything they choose to do.<br><br>
